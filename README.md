# MyReads: A Book Lending App Project

## Front-End Web Development Nanodegree

### Austin Daspit

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project was to build a basic React application that would allow a user to keep track of the status of books
that they wanted to read, were currently reading, or had read before. 

## How to Run

1. Download the zip folder containing the files for this project to your local machine.
2. run npm install within the folder.
3. run npm start
4. Look for the new browser window that should open.

## How to Navigate Through the Application

The home page will have three levels into which books can be sorted: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.

Each book will have a green arrow that will allow you to move the book between levels, or to remove it completely.

A green addition symbol is located at the bottom right of the page, which will take you to the search page.

You can search for new books on this page.

This application was built using an API created by Udacity, and for that reason there are only a limited number of keywords that can
be search (found below)
